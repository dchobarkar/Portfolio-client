        A common misconception for those who want to try freelancing is you need
        years of experience to succeed. As proven by me and countless other
        freelancers, that‚Äôs simply not true. Regardless of the industry, skill,
        or niche, you only need a blueprint or a set of steps you can follow to
        fast track your freelancing success and finally live the life you want.
        In this article, I‚Äôm going to share with you exactly how you can start a
        freelance web design business from home with no experience. Let‚Äôs get
        started. Is Freelancing a Good Career? The answer to this question is
        relative to your personality, working style, and goals. The truth is
        some people work better in a physical office where they can take coffee
        breaks with co-workers or have face-to-face brainstorming ideas for a
        project. On the other hand, some people function better when alone with
        total control over their time and workload. Having the freedom to work
        anywhere at anytime also poses a great challenge to our self-control and
        discipline, so just keep that in mind. If the idea of being your own
        boss appeals to you, then I think you'd love freelancing. How Much Money
        Can You Make as a Freelance Web Designer? The short answer: There's no
        cap on your income. Some freelancers struggle to earn a decent income,
        while others earn 6 figures and a lot more than their full-time income.
        I can personally vouch for this: The truth is, how much you earn as a
        freelance web designer ultimately boils down to you. It's important to
        also look long-term here. You might earn X in the first year or two, but
        as you get more experience, as you get more clients, and as you get
        better at what you do, you can start increasing your salary. Another
        thing to remember is that freelancing on the side is also great - that's
        how I started. So even if you earn enough to pay for food or a vacation
        or whatever, that's awesome, and that's how it starts üòä Tools You Need
        for a Freelance Web Design Business Let‚Äôs start with the basics ‚Äì what
        are the things you need to start a web design business from home? Here
        are 5 things: Designated Workspace Yeah right! üòä You can work anywhere
        - the beach, a coffee shop, hotel lobby, your couch, your bed, a desk,
        etc. Fancy Laptop You don‚Äôt need a MacBook to get started. I had a crap
        laptop for 5 years which I used to learn code and start a freelancing
        business. These are helpful specs: Intel Core i5 or i7 processor Full HD
        resolution, ideally 1920√ó1080 8GB of RAM SSD If you can get a
        computer/laptop with these specs, great. If not, don‚Äôt use that as an
        excuse not to start. Start with what you have. Second-hand computers are
        also okay as long as they‚Äôre still functional. My wife even started
        coding on her Android phone! If you really want it, find a way and just
        do it. Internet Connection You're reading this, so you must have an
        internet connection. If your connection is not reliable, find a coffee
        shop with stable WiFi in the meantime (like I did when starting out). A
        Way of Getting Paid There are many ways to get paid for remote work.
        Some of the most popular are PayPal, Stripe, TransferWise, Bank
        Transfer, Payoneer, and Skrill. PayPal is the most widely used bu,t has
        some of the lowest conversion rates. Business accounts get charged a
        percentage of the sale on top of a fixed fee. In the US, companies pay a
        fee of 2.9% of the transaction amount plus a fixed fee of 30 cents. This
        can really add up, but there are ways to avoid these fees. Personally, I
        use PayPal and Bank Transfer to get paid these days. Learning How to
        Design Websites: Where to Start ‚ÄúWeb design‚Äù goes beyond how the website
        looks. It needs to be effective. An effective website should allow the
        website visitor to perform the desired action they'd like to take or
        learn about, and it should also help the website/business owner to
        achieve their goal (brand awareness, sales, sign ups, downloads, etc.)
        too. To learn how to effectively design websites, you need to start
        with: Conversion Rate Optimization or CRO UX Fundamentals Accessibility
        (a11y) If you master these concepts, you‚Äôll make informed decisions on
        how to layout the website, what features to include and omit, how to
        organize content, and more. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) CRO is
        very important because it‚Äôs literally all your client cares about. Each
        website should be designed to accomplish a goal, which is often to make
        more sales. Let's say you're asked by a client to design a landing page
        with the goal of getting visitors to sign up for a webinar. Not everyone
        who lands on the landing page will sign up. Some will not like watching
        webinars, some will doubt if it‚Äôs going to help them, and so on. But
        those who do sign up are now called ‚Äúconversions‚Äù. Converting visitors
        means getting them to perform your desired action. To illustrate this,
        let‚Äôs take a look at this funnel: cro-web-design As shown here, many
        people enter the funnel but only a few reach the end. A website‚Äôs
        conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who reach the end of the
        funnel by performing your desired actions. Conversion rate optimization,
        is the process of increasing the percentage of visitors who will convert
        or perform your desired action. Whether that‚Äôs to buy, subscribe to a
        newsletter, schedule an appointment, etc. Web Design and CRO As a web
        designer, you need to design the website and include features that are
        known to increase conversion. Here are 3 best practices to design
        websites for maximum conversion: Simplify processes. Make it easy for
        users to do what you want them to do. For example, one of the top
        reasons why users abandon carts during checkout is because of a long and
        complicated process. So, if you want more people to buy, make the
        checkout process as fast and easy as possible. Emphasize one
        call-to-action. Each web page should have only one prominent
        call-to-action to avoid confusing visitors. A landing page that is
        intended to capture emails of qualified leads should only include a
        button or link that will let them enter their emails, nothing else.
        Forget instant pop-ups. Nobody liked having pop-ups blocking their
        screen just seconds after landing on a website. Instead of instant
        pop-ups, use exit-intent pop-ups. These pop-ups only appear once the
        user shows signs of leaving the website like hovering their mouse over
        the X button. This simple tactic is shown to boost conversion rates by
        up to 27% in multiple studies. There's obviously way more to discuss
        about CRO. I suggest reading up on CrazyEgg, Digital Marketer, Moz, CXL,
        and Nielson Norman to learn more about CRO. UX Design Fundamentals UX
        stands for ‚Äúuser experience‚Äù. In relation to websites, it pertains to
        the entire experience of using the website ‚Äì from the aesthetics to the
        navigation, branding, tone, and overall ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the website. UX design
        is often interchanged with the term ‚ÄúUI (user interface) design‚Äù. While
        the two are closely interrelated, their differences are worth noting. UI
        (user interface) design, in the context of websites, is concerned with
        the design elements that impact the look, feel, and interactivity of the
        website. A UI designer thinks about the icons and buttons, color
        schemes, spacing, typography, imagery, and responsive design. On the
        other hand, UX design goes beyond how the end website looks but it dives
        deep into the whole experience. ‚ÄúNo product is an island. A product is
        more than the product. It is a cohesive, integrated set of experiences.
        Think through all of the stages of a product or service ‚Äì from initial
        intentions through final reflections, from first usage to help, service,
        and maintenance. Make them all work together seamlessly.‚Äù ‚Äî Don Norman,
        inventor of the term ‚ÄúUser Experience‚Äù As a UX designer, you should seek
        to understand the following: Who are the target users of the website?
        What are their pain points? What kinds of solutions will solve their
        pain points? What do they do on the website? How can the website be
        improved to give them a better experience? UX is a broad topic that
        deserves your full attention. There are great UX courses on Udemy if
        you're interested to delve into this more. Accessibility (a11y) Did you
        know that certain kinds of strobing or flashing animations can trigger
        seizures? Have you ever wondered how deaf folks access podcast content?
        How do people using right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew
        consume online content? All these questions are questions of
        accessibility. While there are a lot of medical conditions and
        disabilities that can impact the way people use websites, here are some
        of the most common categories of impairments: Visual impairment ‚Äì This
        goes beyond blindness. It also includes people with partial or total
        inability to perceive color contrasts. Hearing impairment Photosensitive
        seizures ‚Äì Includes epilepsy and other conditions that may cause
        seizures when exposed to triggers like flashing lights Motor skills
        (difficulty moving parts of their bodies like hands or fingers)
        Cognitive disabilities (e.g., dyslexia or dementia) It‚Äôs a broad topic
        and there‚Äôs really no fixed set of guidelines that you can use to
        guarantee 100% accessibility of your website. But I found this really
        cool website that gives a checklist of things you can do to help improve
        the experience for everyone who visits your site. Quick Recap: To be
        able to design effective websites, focus less on the small details
        (fonts, colors, etc.) and start with: How to design the website to boost
        conversion rates How to make the entire user experience good for
        everyone How to make the website accessible for everyone Once you learn
        these, you can go crazy with design/aesthetic trends. It can be
        minimalist, modern, popping with impressive animations ‚Äì however you
        envision it. As long as you don‚Äôt lose sight of the Big Three, you‚Äôre
        good. Is It Okay to Use WordPress for Designing Websites? As you read
        more about web designing and developing, you‚Äôll find that there are two
        kinds of web designers (and developers): those who love WordPress and
        those who hate it. I am one of the former. For context: WordPress is a
        content management system that you can use to build websites and manage
        their content including pages and posts. You can add blog posts, upload
        images, edit the layout, and everything you need to do to make a
        website. The only problem is web developers and designers think that
        WordPress is clunky, generates messy codes, slow, and overall does not
        compare with the traditional way of coding websites from scratch. I have
        2 objections: WordPress evolved. It‚Äôs not the same slow old system with
        messy website codes. It now has plugins that enable a complete beginner
        to build a beautiful, functional website that is fast, well-coded, and
        professionally designed for maximum results. You don‚Äôt need to always
        code from scratch. Writing code from scratch for every single project is
        a huge waste of time. You can finish a 5-page website in 1-3 days with
        WordPress. This will give you more time to build your brand and get more
        clients. What I love about WordPress is the robust library of plugins
        that you can use to add functionalities and features to your website.
        Page builders like Divi or Elementor let's you design a web page by
        dragging and dropping elements like headers, images, text boxes, spaces,
        and more. These page builders also have templates that you can reuse so
        you can speed up your process even more.
