    que: "What is a custom design ?",
    ans: "A custom design starts from a blank slate. Every decision is made specifically to suit your needs, from colors to fonts, layout to structure. Every single component is entirely customized for you. With a custom design, your website will be one-of-a-kind. It’s all about getting the right message across and keeping the site structure lean and efficient without unnecessary page bloat.",
  },
  {
    que: "Do I need a custom design or a theme ?",
    ans: "Well, a pre-built theme might cost a bit less—but it’s generic. I specialize in custom-designed themes because it makes anything possible. Doesn’t that sound fun? Instead of trying to mold something into something else, why not start fresh and build it exactly the way you want? Custom design isn’t just about the look—but also how the site functions. Pre-built themes can have baked-in functionality that you’re probably not going to use. It won’t be streamlined or efficient for your needs. A custom-designed theme ensures you can edit everything you need to edit, easily. Many of my clients are designers,and they want a site that doesn’t look like everybody else’s.",
  },
  {
    que: "Will you take a theme and customize it for me ?",
    ans: "Unlikely. But maybe…if you agree to fold all my laundry for the rest of time. See, the thing about themes is—they’re not custom websites—which means they don’t reflect you as well as they could. And I’m all about showing off your unique coolness.",

  {
    que: "How long will this take ?",
    ans: "I take on 2–3 new projects a month and generally book work out 4–6 weeks in advance. Once you provide the copy and we have our kickoff call, your fabulous website will be up and running in about 8–12 weeks.",
  },
  {
    que: "Will my site be responsive ?",
    ans: "Abso-freakin-lutely. Is there any other way? When we work together, your website will be simple to navigate with easy-to-read content on any and every device imaginable.",
